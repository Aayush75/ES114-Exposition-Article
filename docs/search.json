A major appilcation of deck.gl is it’s ability to efficiently visualize geo-spatial data (like maps and 3D scans). It is highly compatible with major basemap providers like Mapbox and Google Maps. It also provides interactive event-handling like picking, highlighting and filtering which allows users to interact with individual datapoints on the maps with ease."

    "text": "Key Features and Explanation\n\n1. GPU Acceleration\nUnlike traditional data visualization libraries that rely heavily on CPU computation, deck.gl enables the rendering of massive datasets directly on the GPU.\n\n\n2. Layer-based Approach:\ndeck.gl visualizations use layers as building blocks. Layers accept data and map it to visual elements rendered on the GPU. Each layer represents a specific type of visualization, and these layers can then be combined together to form complex visuals.\nThe main types of layers are:\n\nCore Layers\nAggregation Layers\nGeo Layers\nMesh Layers\n\nFor an exhaustive list of layers, visit the deck.gl Layer Catalog\n\n\n3. Integration with Mapping Libraries:\ndeck.gl is highly compatible with mapping libraries like Mapbox, Google Maps, OpenStreetMap.\n\n\n4. Compatible With Multiple Data Formats:\ndeck.gl uses loaders.gl to read data and resources. loaders.gl supports various data formats such as CSV, GeoJSON, LAS, 3D Tiles (such as Point Clouds and Batch 3D models), Vector Tiles (such as Mapbox) and many more.\n\n\n5. Interactivity:\ndeck.gl has built-in support for zooming, panning, tooltips and hover events."
