    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`deck.gl` is a powerful and versatile GPU-based framework for creating stunning and interactive visual representations of large datasets. It is an open-source tool built on WebGL originally developed by  Uber and now maintained under the OpenJS Foundation. \n",
    "\n",
    "`deck.gl` is built to handle large datasets efficiently by leveraging GPU capabilites to render complex visualizations. A major appilcation of `deck.gl` is it's ability to efficiently visualize geo-spatial data (like maps and 3D scans). It is highly compatible with major basemap providers like [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com). It also provides interactive event-handling like picking, highlighting and filtering which allows users to interact with individual datapoints on the maps with ease. "

    "To install and run `deck.gl` on your system, you will need `npm` (Node.js package manager).  \n",

    "## Key Features and Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. GPU Acceleration\n",
    "Unlike traditional data visualization libraries that rely heavily on CPU computation, `deck.gl` enables the rendering of massive datasets directly on the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Layer-based Approach:\n",
    "`deck.gl` visualizations use layers as building blocks. Layers accept data and map it to visual elements rendered on the GPU. Each layer represents a specific type of visualization, and these layers can then be combined together to form complex visuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main types of layers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Core Layers\n",
    "- Aggregation Layers\n",
    "- Geo Layers\n",
    "- Mesh Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "For an exhaustive list of layers, visit the [`deck.gl` Layer Catalog](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/layers)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Integration with Mapping Libraries:\n",
    "`deck.gl` is highly compatible with mapping libraries like [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Compatible With Multiple Data Formats:\n",
    "`deck.gl` uses [`loaders.gl`](https://loaders.gl/) to read data and resources. `loaders.gl` supports various data formats such as CSV, GeoJSON, LAS, 3D Tiles (such as Point Clouds and Batch 3D models), Vector Tiles (such as Mapbox) and many more. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Interactivity:\n",
    "`deck.gl` has built-in support for zooming, panning, tooltips and hover events.\n"
